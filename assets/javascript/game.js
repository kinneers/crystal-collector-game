    losses
    Random Number
    Each Crystal's Random Number
    All the clicks added together so far (initialize at 0)

    If the added together so far is less than random number:
    When a crystal is first clicked unhide value:
    Each time a crystal is clicked, add that crystal's number to the clicks added array
    get sum of clicks added array

    If the clicks added together === random number:
    win!- add to wins
    reset

    If the clicks added together is greater than random number:
    lose- add to losses
    reset
